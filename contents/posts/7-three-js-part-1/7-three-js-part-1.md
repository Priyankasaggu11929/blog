<p><span class='first-letter'>T</span>hree.js is one of the libraries of *WebGL*. Three.js provides a lot of functionality that makes it very easy to develop WebGL application.</p>

We will be covering it in two parts:
1. <LinkPost href='/7-three-js-part-1' name='Basics of Three.js' />
2. <LinkPost href='/12-three-js-part-2' name='Introducing Meshes and Geometry' />

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of <LinkPost href='https://threejs.org/' name='Three.js' />


Three.js provides a high level functionality:

- Graphical Primitives
- Three.js has own format optimized for web.
- Useful Math and helper functions.
- We have limited effect in Three.js: sprites, fog, particle engine
- WebGL is not supported in IOS.
- Need knowledge of JS as closure passing function.

#### Below are the basic steps to get started with Three.js:

1. Web browser as chrome
2. Some kind of web server (python or live-server)
3. VS Code
4. To run models and texture we need web server (IIS/ virtual directories)
    - https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/
5. Document for run things locally
    - https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally
6. It uses R67 API‚Äôs
7. To create Three.js scene component we need:
    - Scene
    - Camera
    - Lighting
    - Anchor
8. Three.js uses cartesian coordinate system.

## Object 3D properties 

1. <mark>ID</mark> => Unique number of object instance will assigned automatically by Three.js.
2. <mark>UUID</mark> => Unique identifier again, created automatically by Three.js.
3. <mark>Name</mark> => we used for label the cube as ‚Äùbox‚Äù. We can retrieve object by name.
4. <mark>Position</mark> => Location at the scene.
5. <mark>userData</mark> => Allows user object instance.
6. <mark>Parent/children</mark> => Scene is tree hierarchical and n number of children. The child/parent properties allows us to navigate the hierarchy.
7. <mark>lookAt</mark> => It will allow to rotate an object to face a vector.
8. <mark>getObjectByName</mark> => Retrieve the object by name.
9. <mark>getObjectById</mark> => Retrieve the object by Id.
10. In **debugger console**

```js
var box = exam.scence.getObjectByName(‚Äòbox‚Äô)
// check the value of box
box
// And here we can manipulate the value:
box.position.x = 10
box.position.y = 10
```

Check out <LinkPost href='https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Object3D' name='here' />, to get more understanding about Object 3D.

Now we can create cube using Three.js by following steps:

Import `Three.js` from <LinkPost href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/101/three.js' name='here' /> into index.html file.

<u>index.html:</u>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Cube</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div id="webgl-container">
	</div>
	<script src="script/three.js"></script>
	<script src='script/app.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```


<u>app.js:</u>

```js
var exam = (function() {
	"use strict";
	// after importing scene from three.js we can use camera, lights adn any objects that we want to display.
	// Once we create scene, we need renderer. Renderer will tell how content will displayed on webpage by specifying the type of renderer to use.

	var scene = new THREE.Scene(),
		// Three.js has three rendering layer:
		// webgl: This is most feature rich and most performant.
		// canvas: Canvas doesn‚Äôt support all feature as WebGL does. It‚Äôs back option for those using older browser.
		// SVG: It‚Äôs not part of core library But it is available in example folder.
		renderer = window.WebGLRenderingContext ? new THREE.WebGLRenderer() : new THREE.CanvasRenderer(),
		light = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff),
		camera,
		box;

	function initScence() {
		// rendering content should present
		renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
		// where to render
		document.getElementById("webgl-container").appendChild(renderer.domElement);
		// add light
		scene.add(light)
		// initialize camera
		// Three.js has two main type of camera:
		// 1. PerspectiveCamera which we using, 2. called autographic camera (it will show as SimCity Game. In that we have to integrate multiple camera)

		camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
			// First varibale id FOV is camera frustum vertical field of view. Its' a view from top to bottom of the screen and is specified in degrees.
			// CHanging first varibale is like changing lens on the camera. For most values between 35 to 45 good match.
			// But we need to modify while creating games.
			35,
			// Next parameter is aspect ratio. And this is same sa TV or monitor. This is width/height of the container. We can use window. if we are using
			// for full screen. But if it takes just portion of the page then we need to modify this containing elemnt width and height.
			window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
			// last parameter defines near and far planes. Only objects that are inside this will be rendered. These values are useful for performance.
			// Three.js doesn't calculate outside the boundaries. when we add in our camera by default is's going to point to -Z access, so be looking
			//  into this screen, We can modify with LookAt method, but we are going to leave it for now.
			1,
			1000
		);
		camera.position.z = 100;
		// adding camera to scene
		scene.add(camera)

		// Adding box
		box = new THREE.Mesh(
			// First argument BoxGeometry is for defining dimesion of cube
			new THREE.BoxGeometry(20,20,20),
			// Second Parameter MeshBasicMaterial is sort of covering of the cube.
			new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xCCCCCC})
		);

		// box.name = "box";
		scene.add(box);
		// call the render function here
		render();
	}

	// To render the scene
	function render() {
		// rotating around y axis
		box.rotation.y += 0.01;
		// box.rotation.x += 0.01;
		// box.rotation.y += 0.01;
		// here we can call renderer
		renderer.render(scene, camera);
		// requestAnimationFrame si supported in modern browser and it will amke possible that animation should work smoothly.
		requestAnimationFrame(render);
	}

	// We need to kick off scene initialization here:
	window.onload = initScence;

	// Its doing foe debugging purposes.
	return {
		scene: scene
	}
})();
```

### Manipulating Objects:

1. How to change Position of object?
    - We can position by individual axis
    ```js
    Object.position.x = value
    Object.position.set(x,y,z)
    // Assign new vector free object by new position
    object.position = new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0);
    ```

2. Modified the size (scale):
    ```js
    Object.scale.x = value
    // Change the x axis to 2.5 means 25 units long.
    ```

3. How to rotate:
    - Radian is measured at the centre of the circle and then draw a line at its edge, let‚Äôs called the distance is R. Now wrap it at around of circle , this would be one radian.. There‚Äôs roughly 6.28 radian in a circle. which is 2* pi
      - Convert radians to degree: radians = degrees * (pi/180)
      - Convert degree into radians: degree = radians * (180/pi)

4. Child Objects and transforms:
    All transform property will apply reltaively to the parent on any child objects.


### Common Problems üßê

Need to take care of few points:
- Don‚Äôt forget to add light into scene
- Check all scripts are loaded correctly in console or network tab
- Scale, sometime we forget to increase size
- The scene should come under the camera near and far position.


We have covered the basics concept of asics of three.js, bject 3D Properties and how can we manipulate objects.
